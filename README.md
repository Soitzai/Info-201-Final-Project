Project Description:

The data we will be working with is the parking citations in Los Angeles. The city of Los Angeles collected the data. We get access to the data from kaggle website. Here is the link to the dataset we will be using:https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-parking-citations/version/147. The data will be in .csv format.

Our target audiences are the citizens and officers of Los Angeles. The citizens might want to avoid getting a tickets while the officers want to make the city parking situation better.

They might want to learn :
- What time are tickets issued most frequently
- Where are the tickets
- How much are the tickets


Technical Description
- We will be reading in our data from a static .csv file.
- The data seems really well-formatted. However, we will have to deal with some unknown locations with some tickets.
- We will be using the major libraries mentioned in class since the mapping and graphs we want to do are common ones.
- The size of the dataset would be the major challenges since we have not worked with such a big dataset before
